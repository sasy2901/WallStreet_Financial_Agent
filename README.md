# WallStreet Financial Agent 📈🤖

A specialized Autonomous Agent for financial reasoning, capable of answering queries about SIPs, market trends, and wealth management. Built with **Llama-3 8B**, **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**, and **MinHash Deduplication**.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system uses a **ReAct (Reason + Act)** pattern to dynamically decide when to fetch external data vs. when to use internal logic.
